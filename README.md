# Portfolio
Portfolio of projects I built

## Scaffolding for the Repository
- Creating the first versions of files
- Using Normalize.css version 4.1.1 file from https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/

## Structural revisions
- Revised the Stylesheet into SMACSS styles.
- Modified the main page to include separate project entries, using details/summary
- Create JS file for handling constructing Project entries.
- Created a temporary input data file (JS) to populate the project section.

## Big Issue RESOLVED! By Erica Hendricks
- Thanks to Erica for getting me to use CSS to style the project state when details are shown.
